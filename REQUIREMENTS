1. Design a byte-code format that can be easily transmitted
2. Design a byte-code format that can be easily read by a human
3. Design a high-level language that is more readable and modern than BASIC
4. The interpreter and the compiler must fit on an Arduino Duemilanove/UNO/Nano
5. The interpreter must be faster than python3
6. The compiler must be simple, no semantic analysis, no AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
7. Use only static memory allocation
8. Do not use external dependencies, just C and its standard library
9. Write less than 2000 lines of code to implement the interpeter and the compiler
10. Implement a port for OSX, Windows and Linux, as well as the most popular Arduino boards
